>Codility : Array Rotation

>Problem Statement

-Given an array 'A' consisting of 'N' integers and an integer 'K',

A = [3, 8, 9, 7, 6] and K = 3, the function should return [9, 7, 6, 3, 8].

-write a function that rotates the array K times to the right.

  "return the original array when N is zero
  "return the original array when K is zero
  "return the rotated array
